I was planning on creating a Ruby gem for accessing the Marketo REST API.

I stopped when I discovered that the API call that I need is only available in the SOAP API,
not the REST API.  I might continue work on this once Marketo adds enough features to the REST
API to make it useful for my use cases.

This code still might save somebody a few minutes.  Enjoy.
